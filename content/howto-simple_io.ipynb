This allows a user to *serialize* a Python object, converting it to a byte stream (in our case, a binary file). This is, in general, not recommended, because pickled data can include malicious code which will be executed during unpickling. Furthermore, there may be portability issues: pickled objects may not be loadable on different Python installations. \n",
