# NumPy tutorials

This set of tutorials and educational materials is being developed,
IT IS NOT INTEGRATED IN THE HTML DOCS AT https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/

The goal of this repository is to provide high-quality resources by the
NumPy project, both for self-learning and for teaching classes with. If you're
interested in adding your own content, check the [Contributing](#contributing)
section.

To download a local copy of the `.ipynb` files, you can either
[clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
or navigate to any of the documents listed below and download it individually.

## Content

0. [Learn to write a NumPy tutorial](content/tutorial-style-guide.md): our style guide for writing tutorials.
1. [Tutorial: Linear algebra on n-dimensional arrays](content/tutorial-svd.md)
2. [Tutorial: CS231n Python Tutorial](content/cs231_tutorial.md)
3. [Tutorial: Determining Moore's Law with real data in NumPy](content/mooreslaw-tutorial.md)
4. [Tutorial: Saving and sharing your NumPy arrays](content/save-load-arrays.md)
5. [Tutorial: NumPy deep learning on MNIST from scratch](content/tutorial-deep-learning-on-mnist.md)

## Contributing

We very much welcome contributions! If you have an idea or proposal for a new
tutorial, please [open an issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues)
with an outline. 

Don’t worry if English is not your first language, or if you can only come up
with a rough draft. Open source is a community effort. Do your best – we’ll help
fix issues.

Images and real-life data make text more engaging and powerful, but be sure what
you use is appropriately licensed and available. Here again, even a rough idea
for artwork can be polished by others.

### Why Jupyter Notebooks?

The choice of Jupyter Notebook in this repo instead of the usual format 
([reStructuredText, through Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html))
used in the main NumPy documentation has two reasons:

 * Jupyter notebooks are a common format for communicating scientific
   information.
 * rST may present a barrier for some people who might otherwise be very
   interested in contributing tutorial material.

#### Note

You may notice that some of our content is in markdown format (`.md` files). 
This is part of an ongoing restructuring of the repository workflow. However, 
you can still submit your content as a Jupyter Notebook file.

### Adding your own tutorials

If you have your own tutorial in the form of a Jupyter notebook (a `.ipynb`
file) and you'd like to add it to the repository:

#### Create an issue

Go to [https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues)
and create a new issue with your proposal. Give as much detail as you can about
what kind of content you would like to write (tutorial, how-to) and what you
plan to cover. We will try to respond as quickly as possible with comments, if
applicable.

#### Check out our suggested template

You can use our [Tutorial Style Guide](content/tutorial-style-guide.md) to make
your content consistent with our existing tutorials.

#### Upload your content

Remember to clear all outputs on your notebook before uploading it.
